# Establishing a CbbM screening system

This repository collects bioinformatic analyses for the pooled growth of 16 CbbM variants produced in a *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 host strain, in which native Rubisco was repressed using CRISPRi. 

Illumina sequencing data was analyzed using the [nf-core-crispripipeline](https://github.com/MPUSP/nf-core-crispriscreen/). Details are given in [nextflowcommands_etc.md](nf-core_analysis/documentation/nextflowcommands_etc.md) and all input, output etc. is collected in [nf-core_analysis](nf-core_analysis/).

Plasmid files in .gb format of plasmid used in the associated study are collected in [plasmid_files](plasmid_files/).
